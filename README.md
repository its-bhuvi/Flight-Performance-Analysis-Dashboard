## Overview
The Overview page provides a high-level summary of the airport's performance. Key metrics displayed include:

Total number of flights
Average delay times
On-time performance percentage
Number of delayed flights
Passenger satisfaction scores
This page is designed to give a quick snapshot of overall airport efficiency and key performance indicators

## Delays and Time Analysis
The Delays and Time Analysis page dives deeper into flight delays and their impact on airport operations. This section includes:

Delay Trends: Visualizations showing the trend of delays over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
Delay Causes: Analysis of the primary causes of delays (e.g., weather, technical issues, air traffic control).
Peak Delay Times: Identification of times of day and days of the week with the highest delays.
Delay Distribution: Distribution of delays by duration (e.g., 0-15 minutes, 16-30 minutes, etc.).
This analysis helps identify patterns and potential areas for operational improvements.

## Detailed Flight Analysis
The Detailed Flight Analysis page offers an in-depth look at individual flight data. Key features include:

  * Flight Performance: Performance metrics for specific flights, including departure and arrival times, delays, and cancellations.
  * Route Analysis: Analysis of performance by routes, identifying the best and worst-performing routes.
  * Airline Comparison: Comparison of different airlines' performance, including on-time rates and average delays.
  * Passenger Insights: Insights into passenger volume, satisfaction, and feedback on specific flights.
  * This detailed analysis supports granular investigation into specific flights and routes to identify improvement opportunities.
